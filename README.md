The Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman

"How can we capture the unpredictable evolutionary and emergent properties of nature in software? How can understanding the mathematical principles behind our physical world help us to create digital worlds? This book focuses on the programming strategies and techniques behind computer simulations of natural systems using Processing(http://www.processing.org)."

While reading the book I thought it will be a good idea to covert the source code to Javascript using no third party library. I included two small libraries which mimic the processing environment.
